Vim Flip Comparands
==============

Vim Flip Comparands is a plugin that allows you to flip two comparands
around a comparison operator.

Usage
--------

Place the cursor over a comparison operator and call 

```
:FlipC
```

Installation
------------

I recommend installation via [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

```
Plug 'spktklr/vim-flip-comparands'
```

Limitations
------------

The plugin only works if there are spaces surrounding the comparison
in the braces and the comparison is on the same line. Other issues may
also exist if using exotic comparison syntax, like OR & AND for example.
